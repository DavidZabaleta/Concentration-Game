# Concentration Game (Concentrese)

Made in Oct 2017 from a class project in the university. It was developed with C# and Windows Forms.

The language of the game it's in Spanish.

The functionality it's based on the popular memory game [**_Concentration_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(card_game) "Concentration (card game)").
